# Research-on-Surgical-Robotics-in-the-treatment-of-Glioma
In this survey, an overview of advanced robotic surgical technologies neurosurgical operation is provided. The task of finding the best technology available to ease the pain and suffering of glioma diagnosed patients is an ongoing one. Surgical treatment of brain tumours can be improved through the use of robotic technology and with greater precision and accuracy. In comparison to freehand or conventional neurosurgery, robotic manipulation may be superior when working in narrow surgical corridors. Using magnetic resonance compliant robot called as neuroArm which consist of built in iMRI system, haptic hand controllers, robot manipulators, monitors. An end-effector uses force sensors which can measure tool to tissue interaction forces and transmit this information to a surgeon sits at a workstation equipped with haptic feedback. The measured positional and force date is recorded of the bipolar forceps which is attached to the end-effector. A short explanation will be discussed about CyberKnife SRS system treatment process in glioma diagnosed pregnant women which has a high success rate in eradicating glioma, keeping the fetus safe at the same time by minimizing the dose
